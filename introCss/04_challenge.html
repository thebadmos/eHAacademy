    <h1>Welcome To My Travel Webpage</h1>
    <h3>Top Places to Visit in the World</h3>
    <p>The world is filled with such a wide variety of wonderful destinations and beautiful places
         to visit, it can be quite difficult to compile a list of the best ones.</p> 
    <p>The list also includes specific sites, monuments, and locations, each also worthy of a visit in their own right.</p>     
     <ol>
         <li class="title">Machu Picchu, Peru</li>
         <p>Located high in the Andes mountains of Peru, Machu Picchu is now believed to have been a sacred 
            royal retreat for the Incan rulers. Built in the 15th century AD and abandoned less than a 100 years later, 
            the remote site continues to amaze with its perfectly joined, mortarless, intricate stonework. 
            Huge multi-ton blocks of stone are perfectly joined with each other, without the use of mortar or cement.</p>

         <li class="title">The Grand Canyon, Arizona</li>
         <p>This incredible natural wonder is in the U.S. state of Arizona. It's one of those beautiful places for which photos or video just don't
              do it justice—its sheer size and scope is hard to comprehend.</p>

         <li class="title">Rome, Italy</li>
         <p>The Eternal City is more like a giant, living museum. Visitors are immersed in and surrounded by thousands of years of history. It's a relatively compact city,
              and a three-day itinerary gets you to the minimum number of must-see places.</p>

         <li class="title">Maui, Hawaii</li>
         <p>This Hawaiian island offers a wide range of experiences for visitors. You can surf, enjoy a meal on the beach at a five-star luxury resort in Wailea, ride a horse across a dormant volcano in Haleakala National Park, or hike through a rainforest in the West Maui Mountains. 
             The natural scenery is amazing—it's truly one of the most beautiful islands in the world.</p>

         <li class="title">Masai Mara, Kenya</li>
         <p>Kenya's Masai Mara is an incredible bio-diverse area and a popular safari destination. It's an opportunity to see the "big five" animals (lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and Cape buffalo) all during one trip or, 
             if you're lucky, during one afternoon.</p>
