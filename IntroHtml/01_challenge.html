    <h1>How Bright It Is</h1>
    <p>April. And the air dry  
    As the shoulders of a water buffalo.</p>
    <p>Grasshoppers scratch at the dirt,
        rub their wings with thin legs
        flaring out in front of the soldiers
        in low arcing flights, wings a blur.  </p>  
    <p> The soldiers donâ€™t notice anymore,
        seeing only the wreckage of the streets,
        bodies draped with sheets, and the sun,
        how bright it is, how hard and flat and white. </p>  
    <p> It will take many nails from the coffinmakers
        to shut out this light, which reflects off everything:
        the calloused feet of the dead, their bony hands, 
        their pale foreheads so cold, brilliant in the sun. </p>
